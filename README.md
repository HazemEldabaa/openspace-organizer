# Open space organizer using OOP in Python


## Description
Imagine an office with an open space having 4 tables of 6 seats each.

If you are new colleagues or trying a new style for your atmosphere, you might want to change seats every day to get to know each other better while working alongside each other!

This Python script can be run each time to reassign everybody to a new seat.

## Installation

### Prerequisities: 
* Python 3.x\
Press the green code button and download ZIP, unzip the archive in a directory of your choice and launch the main.py file through the terminal. Ensure that all subfolders have the same name


## Usage

Step 1: Replace "colleagues.txt" with your list of names, ensure that it has the same name and file extension as provided\
**NOTE**: *You must ensure that the number of names in your list does not exceed the capacity of the open space (24 by default)*\
Step 2: Run the main.py script from the terminal\
Step 3: Enjoy your new seating arrangement! The output of an arrangement will be written in an "output.txt" file in the same directory. Run as many times for new arrangements as desired.\
**NOTE 2**: *To change the capacity of the open space, edit the parantheses of the open_space = Openspace() object in main.py with the following format: (tables, seats)*


## Demo

This is what a typical output would look like from the script:
